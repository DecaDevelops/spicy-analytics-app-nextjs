# Requires Node.js to be installed:

node.js can be installed here: [download](https://nodejs.org/en)

once installed, navigate to the root of the folder and run:

```bash
npm i
//once npm i finished, run:

npx drizzle-kit push
// once migration is done run
npm run dev

//should run on:
http://localhost:3000
```

now the app should be useable. ^^
